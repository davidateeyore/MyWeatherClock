# MyWeatherClock
a simple device using ESP32-CYD and modular sensors such as DHT11, Freetronics BaroSensor..

I was messing about with an ESP32-CYD - Cheap Yellow Display trying out the NTP disciplined clock code using the builtin WiFi and tried
 adding some extra bits. The next change will be trying out a combo temp, pressure, humidity module like the AHT20-BMP280 unit available from AliExpress among others.
